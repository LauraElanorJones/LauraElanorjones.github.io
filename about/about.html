    <p>The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
       toolchain technologies.  Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with
       traditional virtual machines.  The name
       "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.</p>
    
    <p>LLVM began as a <a href="pubs/2004-01-30-CGO-LLVM.html">research
       project</a> at
       the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a>, with
       the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable
       of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary
       programming languages.  Since then, LLVM has
       grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of
       subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of
       <a href="Users.html">commercial and open source</a> projects
       as well as being widely used in <a href="pubs/">academic research</a>.  Code
       in the LLVM project is licensed under the
       <a href="docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#new-llvm-project-license-framework">
       "Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions"</a>
       </p>
    
    <p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><p><b>LLVM Core</b> libraries provide a modern source- and
        target-independent <a href="docs/Passes.html">optimizer</a>, along with
        <a href="docs/CodeGenerator.html">code generation support</a> for many
        popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built
        around a <a href="docs/LangRef.html">well specified</a> code representation
        known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").  The LLVM Core
        libraries are <a href="docs/">well documented</a>, and it is particularly
        easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use
        <a href="docs/tutorial/">LLVM as an optimizer and code generator</a>.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a></b> is an "LLVM native"
        C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles,
        extremely useful <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">error
        and warning messages</a> and to provide a platform for building great
        source level tools.
        The <a href="https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a> and
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/">clang-tidy</a> are
        tools that automatically find bugs in your code, and are great examples of the
        sort of tools that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to
        parse C/C++ code.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a></b> builds on
        libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger.
        It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler,
        etc so that it provides an experience that "just works".  It is also
        blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols.
        </p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://libcxx.llvm.org">Libc++</a></b> and
        <b><a href="https://libcxxabi.llvm.org">libc++ ABI</a></b> provide
        a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++
        Standard Library, including full support for C++11 and C++14.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://compiler-rt.llvm.org">Compiler-rt</a></b>
        provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator
        support routines like "<tt>__fixunsdfdi</tt>" and other calls generated when
        a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement
        a core IR operation. It also provides implementations of run-time libraries
        for dynamic testing tools such as
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">AddressSanitizer</a>,
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html">ThreadSanitizer</a>,
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html">MemorySanitizer</a>,
        and
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DataFlowSanitizer.html">DataFlowSanitizer</a>.
        </p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://mlir.llvm.org">MLIR</a></b> is a novel
        approach to building reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure. MLIR
        aims to address software fragmentation, improve compilation for heterogeneous
        hardware, significantly reduce the cost of building domain specific compilers,
        and aid in connecting existing compilers together.
        </p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://openmp.llvm.org">OpenMP</a></b>
        provides an <a href="https://openmp.org">OpenMP</a> runtime for use with the
        OpenMP implementation in Clang.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://polly.llvm.org/">Polly</a></b> implements
        a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and
        vectorization using a polyhedral model.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://libclc.llvm.org/">Libclc</a></b> aims to
        implement the OpenCL standard library.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://klee.llvm.org">klee</a></b> implements a
        "symbolic virtual machine" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate
        all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove
        properties of functions.  A major feature of klee is that it can produce a
        testcase in the event that it detects a bug.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="https://lld.llvm.org/">LLD</a></b> is a new
        linker. That is a drop-in replacement for system linkers
        and runs much faster.</p></li>
    
    <li><p><b>
        <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt">BOLT</a></b>
        is a post-link optimizer. It achieves the improvements by optimizing
        application's code layout based on execution profile gathered by sampling
        profiler.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of
    other projects that <a href="/ProjectsWithLLVM/">use components
    of LLVM for various tasks</a>.  Through these external projects you can use
    LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Rust, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, Julia, and a number of
    other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and
    reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different
    tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages
    like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.</p>
    
    <p>As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people
    who are interested in building great low-level tools.  If you are interested in
    <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html">getting involved</a>, a
    good first place is to skim the <a href="https://blog.llvm.org">LLVM Blog</a> and join <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org">LLVM Discourse</a>.  For information on how to send in a patch, get commit access, and
    copyright and license topics, please see <a href="docs/DeveloperPolicy.html">the
    LLVM Developer Policy</a>.
